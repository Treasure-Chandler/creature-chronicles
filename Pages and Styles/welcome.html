                Below you can view media and read facts about these silly
                creatures by clicking on their respective pages! <br/>
                You can always request new animals to be added by making
                a pull request in my GitHub page, which will be linked below! <br/>
                I am currently in the process of relearning HTML, and I was inspired
                to make this page in order to use my knowledge. <br/>
                I hope you enjoy my silly little encyclopedia that I am making!
